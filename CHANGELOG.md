# Changelog

All notable changes to MultiClaw will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Plugin Uninstall Steps** — Manifests now support an `uninstallSteps` field alongside `postInstallSteps`. When a plugin is removed, the agent runs declared cleanup commands before deleting the plugin folder — unregistering daemons, purging packages, removing data directories, and cleaning up installed CLIs.
- **Uninstall Coverage for All Plugins** — Every plugin in the registry now has a complete uninstall procedure:
  - **Docker** — stops and disables the Docker daemon, purges all `docker-ce` packages via apt, removes `/var/lib/docker`, `/var/lib/containerd`, and `/etc/docker`
  - **Portainer** — removes the `portainer` container, deletes the `portainer_data` volume, and removes the image
  - **Tailscale** — disconnects from the Tailscale network (`tailscale down`), purges the `tailscale` package, removes `/var/lib/tailscale` and `/etc/tailscale`
  - **Browser Control** — removes Chromium browser files from `~/.cache/ms-playwright/`, uninstalls the Playwright Python package
  - **Nmap Unleashed** — runs `pipx uninstall nmapUnleashed` to remove the `nu` CLI
  - **Bankr Agent** — runs `npm uninstall -g @bankr/cli`
  - **AgentPay SDK** — runs the repo's `uninstall:cli-launcher` script or falls back to `npm uninstall -g agentpay`
  - **AgentPay Skill Pack** — removes all skills copied to `~/.claude/skills/` during installation
  - **Superpowers** — removes all skills copied to `~/.claude/skills/` during installation
- **Per-Agent Environment Isolation** — Each spawned agent instance now uses its own `.env` file under `~/.multiclaw/agents/<name>/.env`. The systemd service `EnvironmentFile` directive points to the per-agent file, so `MULTICLAW_PLUGINS_DIR` and `MULTICLAW_SKILLS_DIR` are scoped per agent without any global overrides.
- **Agent Connection Retry** — On startup, the agent retries its registration handshake with the dashboard using exponential backoff (0 / 2 / 5 / 10 / 20 seconds). If the dashboard is temporarily unavailable (e.g., restarting), the agent reconnects automatically instead of failing silently.
- **Built-in Plugin Source Directories** — `hello-plugin`, `docker`, and `portainer` now have source directories in the agent source tree (`multi-claw-agent/plugins/`), enabling the activate endpoint to copy them into per-agent plugin directories correctly.
- **Agent-Side Delete Error Surfacing** — When a plugin deletion request to an agent returns an error, the dashboard now captures and returns the agent's error message in the response. The UI shows a warning when the plugin was removed from the dashboard registry but the agent reported a problem.

### Fixed
- Git plugins (Superpowers, Nmap Unleashed, etc.) now show as **active** based on the `enabled` flag in `plugin.json` rather than requiring a Python class to be loaded in memory — they were incorrectly showing as inactive after each agent restart
- Plugin folders in the per-agent `plugins/` directory are now fully deleted when a plugin is removed — previously the folder persisted because the agent was reading from the wrong `plugins_dir` path
- Manifest uninstall steps for built-in plugins (non-git) are now executed on deletion — the built-in delete path previously skipped manifest cleanup and jumped directly to `shutil.rmtree`

### Changed
- `PluginManifest` dataclass gains `uninstall_steps: list[PluginPostStep]` field
- `parse_manifest()` reads `uninstallSteps` array from manifest JSON
- `ManifestRunner` gains `run_uninstall_steps()` method, mirroring `run_post_install_steps()`
- `GitPluginManager.uninstall()` runs manifest uninstall steps (if declared) before deleting the plugin directory; falls back to `uninstall.sh` only when no manifest steps are defined
- `uninstall_plugin` API endpoint reads the stored manifest from `plugin.json` and runs `uninstall_steps` before calling `shutil.rmtree`
- `uninstall.sh` fallback now inherits the real `HOME` and `PATH` from the process environment (was using a hardcoded restricted env with `HOME` set to the repo directory)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Plugin Manifest System** — Every plugin in the registry now declares its environment variables, dependencies, post-install steps, and health checks in a structured manifest. This is the standard for all current and future plugins.
- **Environment Variable Prompting** — Deploying a plugin that requires configuration (API keys, network settings, auth tokens) now shows a configuration modal before deployment. Required fields are validated, optional fields are collapsible, and secret values are masked.
- **Auto-Generate Support** — Plugins like Bankr Agent and AgentPay SDK can auto-generate secrets, wallets, and API keys during installation. The UI offers an "Auto-generate" toggle for supported variables.
- **Plugin Dependency Validation** — The deploy flow checks that all plugin dependencies are installed on the target agent before proceeding. Portainer requires Docker, AgentPay Skill Pack requires AgentPay SDK, etc. Missing dependencies are shown with clear error messages.
- **Plugin Health Check Endpoints** — New `GET /api/plugins/{slug}/health` endpoint on each agent runs manifest-defined health checks (command, HTTP, Python import, file existence). Dashboard proxies health checks via `GET /api/plugin-registry/:id/health/:agentId`.
- **Health Indicators in UI** — The Plugins tab now shows a Health column with green/red status dots. Click to run health checks and see detailed results for failed checks.
- **Manifest-Driven Post-Install** — When a manifest is provided, the agent runs specific post-install steps instead of generic auto-detection. Steps run sequentially with per-step timeouts, progress tracking, and error reporting.
- **Per-Plugin Setup Scripts** — Docker, Portainer, Browser Control (Playwright), and Tailscale have dedicated setup scripts for system-level installation with multi-distro support.
- **10 Complete Plugin Manifests** — Superpowers, Shannon, AgentPay SDK, AgentPay Skill Pack, Bankr Agent, Docker, Portainer, Browser Control, Tailscale, and Hello Plugin all have full manifests with env vars, dependencies, post-deploy steps, and health checks.

### Changed
- Plugin deploy timeout increased from 60s to 600s for manifest-driven installs (system packages like Docker can take minutes)
- Plugin registry API responses now include parsed manifest objects
- Deploy route accepts `envVars` alongside `agentIds` and forwards both manifest and env vars to agents
- `agentRegistryPlugins` status enum expanded with `"configuring"` and `"installing"` states
- Undeploy and update routes now use `resolveAgentUrl()` for Tailscale compatibility (was using `agent.url` directly)
- Seed registry rewritten with `upsertPlugin()` helper that backfills manifests on existing entries

### Security
- SSL verification only disabled for localhost health checks (self-signed certs), not globally
- Python import paths validated against `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_.]*$` to prevent code injection
- File existence checks use `expanduser()` for tilde expansion
- Environment variable values injected via subprocess env (not shell interpolation) to prevent injection
- Env var values never logged — only key names are logged

### Database
- New migration `0016_plugin_manifests.sql`: adds `manifest` text column to `plugin_registry` table

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Dashboard Brain** — The dashboard now has its own LLM-powered administrator profile that answers queries directly when no agents are @mentioned. Customizable personality in Settings with auto-injected live system state (agent list, statuses, task counts).
- **@Mention Agent Tagging** — Replaced agent selection buttons with Slack-style @mention autocomplete in the task prompt. Type `@` to see a dropdown of agents with status indicators. Agents appear as inline blue pills and in a tag bar above the editor.
- **Parallel Task Execution** — When multiple agents are @mentioned, tasks dispatch to all agents simultaneously (not sequentially). Each agent works independently and results stream in real-time as they complete.
- **Dashboard Synthesis** — After all parallel agents complete, the dashboard automatically synthesizes a unified summary of all results, noting agreements, contradictions, and gaps.
- **Centralized Memory Integration** — Relevant knowledge base entries are injected into agent prompts before dispatch. Agent results and dashboard syntheses are written back to the knowledge base for future reference.
- **Orchestrations Database Table** — Task orchestrations are now persisted to SQLite (previously in-memory only), enabling task history queries and surviving server restarts.
- **Dashboard Profile Settings** — New "Dashboard Profile" section in Settings page with custom instructions textarea and live context preview showing auto-injected system state.
- **Keyword Fallback Search** — Memory context search falls back to keyword matching when OpenAI embeddings are unavailable, ensuring memory injection works with only an Anthropic API key.
- New SSE/WebSocket events: `dashboard_answer_start`, `dashboard_answer`, `synthesis_start`, `synthesis_complete`, `synthesis_error`

### Changed
- Task dispatch UI completely redesigned — `contenteditable` Lexical editor replaces plain textarea
- Send button dynamically shows "Ask Dashboard" (no tags) or "Dispatch to N agents" (with tags)
- Sequential chain execution replaced by parallel dispatch as default mode
- `executeChain()` preserved as deprecated for programmatic API use

### Dependencies
- Added `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (server — dashboard LLM calls)
- Added `lexical`, `@lexical/react`, `@lexical/plain-text` (client — @mention editor)

- Settings link moved to top-right nav for consistency

### Changed
- Default admin email set to `admin@multiclaw.dev` when not configured
